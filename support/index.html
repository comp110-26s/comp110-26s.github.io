<li>Email TAs: Logistical concerns</li>
<li>Email <a href="mailto:comp110help@gmail.com" class="email">comp110help@gmail.com</a>: Assignment extension requests, logistical concerns; personal issues and emergencies that impact performance in the course</li>

<h1 id="office-hours-tutoring">Office Hours + Tutoring</h1>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h2>
<p>Come drop in for one-on-one support in office hours with a member of the <a href="/resources/team.html">COMP110 team</a>. With the exeption of Exercise due dates, the average wait time is typically less than two minutes. Please expect to wait longer on Exercise due dates.</p>
<p>Office hours is the ideal place to come for one-on-one help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercises</li>
<li>Conceptual Questions</li>
<li>Lessons</li>
<li>Challenge Questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Typical office hours are listed to the right, but check the hours on the <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/">CSXL website</a> for the most up-to-date availability this week.</p>
<p>Office hour interactions for programming exercises are limited to 15 minutes and <strong>one specific question</strong> per appointment in order to be as fair as possible to all students enrolled. For longer, conceptual help outside of specific assignments, we encourage you to visit office hours on non-deadline days.</p>
<p>In order to serve every student in the course as best we can, we must enforce a 1-hour wait period between appointments with a given student. During this time, we expect you to continue making substantive progress on your programming exercise. If you anticipate needing significant amounts of help on an assignment, please start as far in advance as possible so you will have multiple opportunities to ask questions as they arise. Realizing you need help more than once in a given day is an indication you would benefit from a stronger conceptual understanding of the material in question and it would be great for you to come work with us during tutoring hours!</p>
<h2 id="tutoring">Tutoring</h2>
<p>Come to Tutoring hours for conceptual help with members of the COMP110 UTA team and small groups of your peers. You can find these locations and links on <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/" target="_blank">the CSXL site</a>, just like office hours. If you are feeling a little behind or as though you could use some extra practice, tutoring is for you! Tutoring does not have time constraints (outside of the hours it is open).</p>
<p>Tutoring is a great opportunity to find help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual Questions</li>
<li>Lecture Review</li>
<li>Practice</li>
<li>Quiz/Exam Preparation</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: We must stop taking tickets at the closing time for both office hours and tutoring. If the queue is long enough that we do not believe we will be able to see all tickets before we close, we will turn off the ability to submit new tickets before closing time.</p>
<p>To work with us in office hours or tutoring, <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/" target="_blank">visit the CSXL site</a>. Please already be in Fred Brooks/Sitterson Hall when you submit a ticket so a TA can help you as soon as they are available.</p>
<h1 id="email">Email</h1>
<p>In general, we cannot help with programming or assignment questions via e-mail; instead, please come see us in office hours for help on assignments. Over the years, we have learned that it is too difficult, time consuming, and frustrating for you and for us to try and resolve technical issues via screenshots e-mailed back and forth. Thus, we will redirect any such emails to office hours (described above).</p>
<!-- To participate in remote office hours:

1. Begin a Zoom meeting. **Please have your camera on and _do not share your screen_ until asked to do so!**
2. Hover over your meeting's window and click the green shield icon in the top-left corner 
3. Click "Copy Link" to copy the URL to your Zoom meeting
4. <a href="https://course.care/ng/course/85" target="_blank">Open Course.Care click "Check-in" for currently open office hours</a>. Select what kind of help you are seeking and paste in your Zoom URL. Be detailed and descriptive in your request for help. If you fail to make an honest effort to describe the purpose of the meeting, TAs are instructed to cancel your request.
5. Our teaching team will get to you as soon as we can! -->
<!-- ### Ed Stem for on-line Q&A About Lessons / Conceptual Help 

Join EdStem here <https://edstem.org/us/join/KuDPny>. Do not make public posts about programming exercises. Come work with us in office hours with these questions or mark them as posting to "instructors only". Unless we are able to answer a question very quickly, it is likely we will redirect you to office hours in any case. Piazza is primarily available for conceptal questions about course and lecture concepts, or when tutoring is not open. -->
<h1 id="feedback">Feedback</h1>
<p>If you have suggestions on how to improve the course or just want to leave some positive, encouraging feedback for the TAs or instructor, <a href="https://airtable.com/appJjqVMSOFr9kspg/pagypkXbzqLgSjMBc/form">please give us feedback</a>. If you make a suggestion we’re able to act on, we’re more than happy to!</p>
