<h3 id="office-hours-and-tutoring-in-person">Office Hours and Tutoring In-person</h3>
<p>The most valuable resources in COMP110 are office hours and tutoring; view the Support page on this site for more information. These resources expect in-person, face-to-face attendance and will not be available remotely unless otherwise stated, or if you have relevant accomodations.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>The instructors and the COMP110 team value the perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds reflecting the diversity of our students. We broadly define diversity to include race, gender identity, national origin, ethnicity, religion, social class, age, sexual orientation, political background, and physical and learning ability. We strive to make this classroom an inclusive space for all students. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to improve; we appreciate suggestions.</p>
<h2 id="textbooks-and-resources">Textbooks and Resources</h2>
<p>The web page is the primary resource for this course. There is no textbook for COMP110. We will distribute occasional readings, reference material, and tutorials via the course website and Canvas.</p>
<h2 id="course-description-target-audience-and-prerequisites">Course Description, Target Audience, and Prerequisites</h2>
<p>COMP110 introduces students to programming and data science from a computational perspective. With an emphasis on modern applications in society, students gain experience with problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, abstraction design, and ethics in computing. No prior programming experience is expected or needed. Foundational concepts include data types, sequences, boolean logic, control flow, functions/methods, classes/objects, input/output, data organization, transformations, and visualizations.</p>
<p>Pre-requisite: A C or better in one of the following courses: MATH 130, 152, 210, 231, 129P, or PHIL 155, or STOR 112, 113, 120, 151, 155.</p>
<h2 id="goals-and-key-learning-objectives">Goals and Key Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>This course is intended to teach basic computer programming skills to students ranging from those with no prior programming experience to those with some prior experience. This course aims to teach general programming language concepts and semantics, problem definition, problem solving, logical and recursive thinking, through algorithm development and writing programs. Additionally, the course offers broad exposure to some of today’s key issues of computing in society.</p>
<h3 id="ideas-in-action-general-education-curriculum">IDEAs in Action General Education Curriculum</h3>
<p>This is an FC-QUANT course in the IDEAs in Action curriculum. The following are the Student Learning Outcomes and Questions for FC-QUANT courses:</p>
<h4 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h4>
<p>These are the learning outcomes that are expected of students after completing a course.</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize, interpret, and present quantitative data in mathematical forms, such as graphs, diagrams, tables, or mathematical text.</li>
<li>Develop or compute representations of data using mathematical forms or equations as models, and use statistical methods to assess their validity.</li>
<li>Make and evaluate important assumptions in the estimation, modeling, and analysis of data, and recognize the limitations of the results.</li>
<li>Apply mathematical concepts, data, procedures, and solutions to make judgments and draw conclusions.</li>
<li>Synthesize and present quantitative data to others to explain findings or to provide quantitative evidence in support of a position.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-for-students">Questions for Students</h4>
<p>These are the types of questions you should be able to answer after completing a course.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the role of mathematics in organizing and interpreting measurements of the world?</li>
<li>How can mathematical models and quantitative analysis be used to summarize or synthesize data into knowledge and predictions?</li>
<li>What methodology can we apply to validate or reject mathematical models or to express our degree of confidence in them?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-load-expectation">Course Load Expectation</h2>
<p>COMP110 is a rigorous introductory STEM course. Learning how to program is an acquired, practiced skill much like playing a musical instrument or learning a new craft. The amount of time you individually spend practicing programing and working on assignments, outside of any other help, will significantly impact your success in the course. You should expect to spend 3 hours per week on lecture and async lessons in addition to 9 hours per week working on assignments and studying. We DO NOT recommended taking COMP110 in a semester when you are enrolled in 17 or more credit hours.</p>
<h2 id="course-requirements-and-policies">Course Requirements and Policies</h2>
<p>You should attend all lecture days in person and check the course page for announcements and updates. You should complete all programming and reading assignments on time.</p>
<p>Please show up to lectures at least five minutes early so the class can begin at its scheduled start time.</p>
<h2 id="grading-criteria">Grading Criteria</h2>
<p>To do well in this course, you must come to your own individual mastery of introductory programming concepts and engage with broader intellectual questions of computing in society. Final grades are calculated with the following weights for each course component:</p>
<ul>
<li>45% - Preparation, Practice, Participation
<ul>
<li>30% - (EX) Programming Exercises</li>
<li>5% - (LS) Async Lesson Responses on Gradescope (Graded for Correctness)</li>
<li>5% - (CQ) In-class Challenge Questions (Graded for Correctness)</li>
<li>5% - (CL) In-class Participation (Graded for Completion)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>55% - Mastery
<ul>
<li>40% - 4x Quizzes</li>
<li>15% - Final Exam</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The fairest way to assess mastery of material is through a combination of timed assessments, excercises with “on your own” sections, and open-ended project work.</p>
<p>Taking at least three of the four quizzes and the final exam is required to be eligible to pass COMP110.</p>
<p>The cumulative final exam is worth 55% of your final grade at the start of the term. Each quiz you take accounts for 10% of your final grade and reduces the weight of your final examination by 10%.</p>
<p>For example: By taking all 4 quizzes, your final exam’s weight is 15% of your final grade. If you must be absent from a quiz (see policy below), then the 3 quizzes you take will account for 30% of your final grade and your final exam will account for 25%.</p>
<p><strong>If, and only if, you take all 4 quizzes and your final examination score exceeds your lowest quiz score, then we will retroactively grant you an absence for the lowest quiz score and your final exam score will be worth 25%.</strong></p>
<h2 id="quiz-absence-policy">Quiz Absence Policy</h2>
<p>The quizzes will be held during the section you are registered for and are synchronous and in-person. These dates, and the final exam date, are required synchronous dates.</p>
<p>You may be absent for up to one quiz. To request absence from a quiz, you should submit <a href="https://airtable.com/appJjqVMSOFr9kspg/pagwai6933foGwE0w/form">this form</a> before your absence.</p>
<p>To ensure these assessments are fair for all students enrolled in COMP110 this term, we can only offer quiz makeups for officially documented university-approved absences. You must show the instructor proof of a university-approved absence and be available to take the quiz within two business days of the official quiz date. Merely being absent from a quiz that is not university approved results in the quiz’s credit not being drawn down from your final exam score’s weight. As such, this is not a penalty; your mastery of this quiz’ material will be assessed on the cumulative final exam.</p>
<p>We can offer everyone absent from a quiz the same learning experience of sitting for the quiz at some later date and receiving feedback on it, but a quiz taken in this fashion is not for credit and will not count toward nor against your mastery grade to ensure fairness to all students.</p>
<h2 id="course-passage-policy">Course Passage Policy</h2>
<p>In order to pass COMP110, you must accomplish ALL of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a passing grade given the rubric of weights above and grading scale below</li>
<li>Take at least 3 quizzes</li>
<li>Score greater than 40% on the final exam</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="honor-code-and-collaboration-policy">Honor Code and Collaboration Policy</h2>
<p>In order to do well in this course, you must come to your own individual understanding of the material. As such, collaboration is prohibited outside of the following policies.</p>
<p>Make sure that you are familiar with The UNC Honor Code. You will be required to sign an Honor Code pledge to hand in with every quiz and the final as well as “sign” the code you submit for grading by filling in your PID in the required <code>__author__</code> variable. Failing to do so may result in no credit assigned for the assignment.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-policy-on-ungraded-general-course-concepts">Collaboration Policy on Ungraded, General Course Concepts</h3>
<p>You absolutely may, and are encouraged to, discuss general course concepts (i.e. not assignment-specific) material with anyone, including other current students and tutors. This includes going over lecture slides, documentation, code examples covered in lecture, study guides, etc. The examples you use to discuss general course materials must be from lecture or your own creativity, you cannot use examples directly drawn from any assignments handed in.</p>
<h3 id="collaboration-on-graded-work">Collaboration on Graded Work</h3>
<p>No collaboration with peers inside the course, or anyone outside the course, with the exception of our course TAs while they are working as a TA, is allowed on exercises, lecture assignments, quizzes, and exams. Your ability to complete each individually is critical for your ability to do well in this course. Illegal collaboration is easily detected in COMP110 because Gradescope has built-in support for Stanford’s MOSS program (Measures of Software Similarity), as well as other machine learning techniques. Every year, a number of violations are caught and prosecuted in the Honor Court, so far always resulting in guilty convictions and sanctions. Avoiding any fears here is simple: work on assignments and assessments on your own and come to office hours when you have questions. Please note that if you know someone who is a UTA, you are only permitted to receive help from them while they are working in their official capacity. Receiving help from a UTA outside of their working hours is considered an unfair advantage for academic gain and is an honor code violation.</p>
<h3 id="permitted-resources-on-graded-work">Permitted Resources on Graded Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Materials on the course website and any linked resources</li>
<li>Instruction received from UTAs</li>
<li>Official programming language documentation</li>
<li>Online documentation for specific errors you encounter</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are not permitted resources on coursework handed in for credit and are considered honor code violations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking for help on an assignment or assessment on GroupMe, or any other mobile or web application, groupchat, or forum.</li>
<li>Talking about specific assignments with peers in the course, or anyone outside the course, with the exception of UTAs in Office Hours or Tutoring.</li>
<li>Looking at someone else’s screen, whether in person or shared remotely, while working on an assignment. Letting someone else look at or share your screen.</li>
<li>Copying code found on any website or community such as StackOverflow, Github, Chegg, CourseHero, or any generative AI model (e.g., ChatGPT).</li>
<li>Sharing or reusing code with any peer currently in the course or anyone who has previously taken the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, ask the instructor.</p>
<h3 id="tutors-and-informal-help-from-comp-friends">Tutors and Informal Help from COMP Friends</h3>
<p>Tutors, tutoring organizations, and COMP friends <strong>are not allowed</strong> to help you with any assignments handed in for credit. They may help you with general course concept questions, however we encourage you to rely on TA assistance foremost.</p>
<h3 id="code-review-test">Code Review Test</h3>
<p>I reserve the right to, at any time, ask you to submit to a “code review” test with me or a head TA. We may ask you to meet to explain any line of code or decision made in your program that we deem suspicious or confusing. Thus, you should be able to comfortably explain why you (and you alone) wrote any single line of code in an assignment handed in for credit. Should you be unable to do so, your grade will be a zero for the assignment in question and you may be taken to honor court depending on the severity of the infraction.</p>
<h3 id="autograding-and-resubmissions">Autograding and Resubmissions</h3>
<p>Grades on programming assignments have two components: autograded points and manually graded points. You should take note of how many autograded vs. manually graded points there are ahead of submission. You are permitted, and encouraged, to resubmit your programming assignments as many times as you need in order to earn full credit on the autograded points of an assignment. There is no penalty for resubmission. The autograder will run and assign a score within a few minutes of submission. We will not go back and manually assign any credit for autograder points you didn’t earn, so you can know and be aware of your autograded points as soon as the autograder has finished testing your code. If you do not understand the error output of some autograded point deduction, please come see us in office hours!</p>
<h3 id="early-submission-of-programming-assignments">Early submission of programming assignments</h3>
<p>Programming assignments (exercises and projects) whose final submission is made 48 hours, or more, before their deadline will receive a 5% early hand-in bonus on the assignment’s autograded score. Submissions that fall within the early window of 24-48 hours before the deadline will receive a 3% early hand-in bonus. Submissions made within 24 hours of the deadline are not subject to any bonus. The early hand-in bonus does not apply to manually graded points on projects.</p>
<h3 id="regrade-requests">Regrade Requests</h3>
<p>Regrade requests for quizzes and other manually graded assignments are open for one week following the release of the grade. If you missed any of the points on a given assignment, you should review work as soon as grades are posted to be sure you understand why you missed something. This will help bring your understanding of concepts closer to comprehension faster. In the event we graded something improperly, select the specific question on gradescope and click the “Regrade Request” button at the bottom. If there are multiple questions, submit multiple requests one per question, rather than batching them together. Do not use regrade requests to ask why something is wrong, come work with us in tutoring or office hours to understand the problem at hand.</p>
<h2 id="late-policies-and-drops">Late policies and Drops</h2>
<p>All assignments, outside of assessments such as quizzes and the final exam, will have an 11:59pm deadline on their due date.</p>
<p>Lesson responses and programming exercises will all have deadlines and late periods. The following policies apply:</p>
<p>Lesson and Challenge Question responses on Gradescope are assigned on lecture days and must be completed before 11:59pm the same day unless noted otherwise. To ensure fairness to everyone, as emergencies may arise, we will drop the 2 lowest lesson scores and the 1 lowest challenge question score, including zeros.</p>
<p>For all assignments, submissions made after the deadline will have a 15% late penalty applied.</p>
<h2 id="late-point-forgiveness-insurance">Late Point Forgiveness Insurance</h2>
<p>As “insurance” against illness, computer crashes, sporting events, conflicts with other coursework, and <em>waves arms around in the air</em> life, every student in the course is automatically forgiven the following points worth of late penalties on assignments at the end of the term:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lessons: forgiven up to 2 late lesson penalties</li>
<li>Challenge Questions: forgiven up to 2 late CQ penalties</li>

<!-- ### Late policies

All assignments, outside of assessments such as quizzes and the final exam, will have an 11:59pm deadline on their due date.

Lesson responses, challenge questions, and programming exercises will all have deadlines and late periods. After the late period begins, there is a 1-hour grace period in which no penalty is applied. Beyond that grace period, the following policies apply:

Challenge Question responses on Gradescope are assigned on some lecture days (Mon/Wed/Fri) and must be completed before 11:59pm the same day unless noted otherwise. If handed in after the 1-hour grace period described above, a 5% late penalty will be applied for each day it is late, capping at 80%, at the end of the semester. No lesson responses will be accepted beyond 11:59pm four days following the original deadline. To ensure fairness to everyone, as emergencies may arise, we will drop the two lowest lesson response scores and single lowest challenge question response score, including zeros.

Programming and reading assignments - submissions made after the deadline, outside of the 1-hour grace period described above, will have a 5% late penalty applied for each day it is late (e.g., if you submit one day late, the highest grade you could get is a 95%; after two days, you could get a 90%), capping at 80%. Exercises cannot be handed in beyond their 6-day late period, which follows the original deadline. -->
<!-- ### Late Point Forgiveness Insurance

As “insurance” against illness, computer crashes, sporting events, conflicts with other coursework, and *waves arms around in the air* life, every student in the course is automatically forgiven the following points worth of late penalties on assignments at the end of the term:

* Lessons: 60% (e.g. forgiven up to 4x late lesson penalties)
* Exercises: 30% (e.g. forgiven up to 2x late exercise penalties)
* Readings: 15% (e.g. forgiven up to 1x late reading assignment)

Like real insurance, there is no reward for not needing to use these points and you should try to avoid using them outside of unpredictable, emergency situations like a computer needing repair. -->
